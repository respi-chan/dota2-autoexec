> Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you, who regiment your lives,
> tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle,
> use you as cannon fodder! Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men- machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
> You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have a love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate!
> Only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!
